# Lego Simulator

In this project, the scope was that of simulating a lego game, where builders would need to get materials from the quarry to build specific buildings. Each type of building would have a different requirement with regards to the materials needed. The objective of this project is that of having the quarry start with a certain amount of materials and pass the parser a number of buildings which need to be built. The parser's objective is that of assigning builders to build as many buildings from the list as possible, without making use of non-existing resources. The output would be the amount of buildings successfully built and the amount of material remaining in the quarry.

The basic 4 OOP principles were used, along with multiple inheritance and various design patterns such as the factory pattern.
