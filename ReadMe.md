# Lego Simulator

In this project, the scope was that of simulating a lego game, where builders would need get materials from the quarry to build specific buildings. Each type of building would have a different requirement with regards to materials needed. The objective of this project is that to start the quarry with a certain amount of materials and pass the parser a number of buildings which need to be built. The parser's objective is that of building as many buildings from the list as possible, without making use of non-existing resources.
